## Lab: 33
## Feature Tasks and Requirements:


#### Features - Django
- Add JWT Authentication to your API.
- Install needed libraries in project configuration and/or site settings.
- Keep any pre-existing authentication so DRF Browsable API still usable.
- Install needed libraries in project configuration and/or site settings.


#### Features - Docker
- Create a boilerplate Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml so you don’t need to start from scratch each time.
- E.g. as a VS Code snippet, or a gist.
- Switch to using Gunicorn instead of Django’s built in development server.
- mind the number of workers to avoid sluggishness
- Warning You will run into styling issues when you switch over to Gunicorn.
- On Django side you’ll need to properly handle static files using Whitenoise
